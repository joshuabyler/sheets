## Requirements

1. You will need node v18 you should use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. You will need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
3. You'll also need to create a `secrets.json` and `.env` file at the root of the repository. Information from those will come from Josh
4. Now you're ready to run `yarn` from the terminal, this will take care of installing everything you need to run the project.
5. Once that's done, run `yarn dev` and you'll be able to see the site at `localhost:3000`
